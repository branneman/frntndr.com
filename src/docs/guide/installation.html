        <h1>Installation</h1>

        <h2>1. Install dependencies</h2>

        <h3>1.1. Node.js</h3>
        <p>First of all, you need <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. You'll need at least Node.js version 0.10.x
            to run frntndr.</p>
        <p>Node can be installed in several ways, but to ensure you can swap versions easily, I advise you don't install
            Node directly, but use a version manager instead. There are several version managers available, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> (unix) or
                <a href="https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw">nvmw</a> (windows)</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/n">n</a> (unix) or
                <a href="https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist">nodist</a> (windows)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's also great to use a version manager because Node.js releases fast, and frntndr will keep testing on the
            latest and greatest of the stable branch. Stuff might get added that only works on the newer versions.</p>
        <p>If you are not going to use Node.js for anything else right now, directly downloading and installing from the
            <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> site will do fine. Updating Node is just more of a drag then.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Ruby &amp; Sass</h3>
        <p>Since the best implementation of Sass is in Ruby at the time of writing, you'll need that. Once the C
            implementation has better compatibility with the Ruby implementation, we'll switch over to the much faster
            <a href="https://github.com/hcatlin/libsass">libsass</a>. You can track the progress
            <a href="https://github.com/branneman/frntndr/issues/3">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Ruby is bundled with OSX, so you won't have to install that manually. Windows users have to download Ruby
            from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you've got Ruby up and running, install Sass with this command:</p>
        <code class="block">gem install sass</code>
        <p>If you get an error while installing Sass, you might have a version of Ruby which doesn't play nice with
            Sass. Try 1.9 or 2, 64bit should be fine.</p>

        <h2>2. Install frntndr via npm</h2>
        <p>All you have to do is run this:</p>
        <code class="block">npm i -g frntndr</code>
        <p>From now on, you can create new projects with the <code>frntndr</code> command-line tool. If you are new to
            frntndr, you could start with the <a href="/docs/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>.</p>
