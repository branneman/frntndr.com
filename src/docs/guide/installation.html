        <h1>Installation</h1>

        <h2>1. Install dependencies</h2>

        <h3>1.1. Node.js</h3>
        <p>First of all, you need <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. You'll need at least Node.js version 0.10.x
            to run frntndr.</p>
        <p>Node can be installed in several ways, but to ensure you can swap versions easily, I advise you don't install
            Node directly, but use a version manager instead. There are several version managers available, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">nvm</a> (unix) or
                <a href="https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw">nvmw</a> (windows)</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/n">n</a> (unix) or
                <a href="https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist">nodist</a> (windows)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's also great to use a version manager because Node.js releases fast, and frntndr will keep testing on the
            latest and greatest of the stable branch. Stuff might get added that only works on the newer versions.</p>
        <p>If you are not going to use Node.js for anything else right now, directly downloading and installing from the
            <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> site will do fine. Updating Node is just more of a drag then.</p>

        <h3>1.2. Ruby</h3>
        <p>Ruby is bundled with OSX, so you won't have to install that manually. Windows users have to download Ruby
            from <a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you've got Ruby up and running, install <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> with this command:</p>
        <code class="block">gem install bundler</code>

        <h2>2. Install frntndr via npm</h2>
        <p>All you have to do is run this:</p>
        <code class="block">npm i -g grunt-cli bower frntndr</code>
        <p>From now on, you can create new projects with the <code>frntndr</code> command-line tool. If you are new to
            frntndr, you should start with the <a href="/docs/walkthrough.html">Walkthrough</a>.</p>
